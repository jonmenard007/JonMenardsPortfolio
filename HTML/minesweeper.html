    <h4>1. MineSweeper </h4>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong> The objective of this game is to clear all the bombs in the grid. When a tile is left clicked it will display however many bombs
    are touching it including diagonal tiles. If the tile is not touching any tiles, it will search the tiles beside it until it finds tiles which
    are adjacent to bombs. Right clicking will place a flag on the tile. Once all the bombs are flagged, the game is won. If is bomb is left clicked
    the game is over and all the remaning bombs will be displayed. Selecting "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" will reset the game and generate 20,40, or 60 
    bombs respectivily.
