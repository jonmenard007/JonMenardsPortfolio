            <h3>1. MineSweeper </h3>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong> The objective of this game is to clear all the bombs in the grid. When a tile is left clicked it will display however many bombs
            are touching it including diagonal tiles. If the tile is not touching any tiles, it will search the tiles beside it until it finds tiles which
            are adjacent to bombs. Right clicking will place a flag on the tile. Once all the bombs are flagged, the game is won. If is bomb is left clicked
            the game is over and all the remaning bombs will be displayed. Selecting "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" will reset the game and generate 10, 25, or 40 
            bombs respectivily.

            <h3>3. Evolutionary AI</h3>
            <strong>Description: </strong>
            This is an example of an extremely simple artificial intelligence. Using a ranking system, the top half of dots from the previous 
            generation are duplicated and passed on to the next generation. Each dot's instruction is then mutated based off how well they did, 
            and another attempt to reach the destination is attempted. The process is repeated endlessly. A perfect result will never be achieved,
             since mutation will always occur. Over time the dots should make progress towards the destination, however because of how simple this algorithm
              is, it is possible for a solution to never happen.<br><br>
            <strong>Instructions: </strong>
            In order to run a simulation, press Start. Clicking and dragging will draw rectangles that the dots must avoid. Pressing Undo will remove the last 
            object drawn. Reset clears the entire screen. Pressing Stop will pause the simulation. Show More and Show Less will toggle the amount of generations 
            that are run in the background before another one is shown.
