                I am a student, currently in my third-year studies of Software Engineering at Carleton University. I was first introduced to software development five years ago when 
                I took an "Intro to Coding" class in grade 11. From the moment I wrote my first line, "Hello world!" and saw it appear on the screen, I fell in love. I have 
                since had experience writing in: 
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>Lisp</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>UNIX command line</li>
            
                </ul>
                I have also gained experience working in groups using Github to host our projects. At the moment I am working on a elevator control system along with 4 other people that will run on 3 complete seperate computers. We will be using UDP datagram packets to comunicate between different threads inorder to communicate between computers. I have built my own computer and I am particularly strong in Java and Javascript. 
                <br>
                My passion for Software Engineering is fueled by trying to solve complex problems that seem impossible. I thoroughly enjoy coding the logic behind the function of the program. I have created this portfolio all on my own, coding everything from scratch in my free time. 
                Shown in the projects section are four short projects; MineSweeper and Snakes, Flappy Bird and my first attempt at artificial intelligence using the genetic algorithm, which I have created to help illustrate my excitement for Software Engineering.

                Outside of school, I enjoy staying active and having fun.
